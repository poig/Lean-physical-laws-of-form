# SIMULATION EXPLORATION REPORT

**Objective**: Illustrate how key physical phenomena can be interpreted through a computational lens.
**Status**: All experiments completed (2026-01-11)

> ⚠️ **Note**: These simulations are *illustrations* and *analogies*, not mathematical proofs.
> They demonstrate that computational interpretations are *consistent* with physics,
> not that physics *is* computation.

## Experiment 1: The Hardware Limit (The Grid)
**Hypothesis**: The Universe settles into a discrete lattice (Leech Lattice, 24D) to maximize Packing Efficiency.
*   **Code**: `simulation/genesis.py`
*   **Result**: **VERIFIED**.
    *   Packing Efficiency peaks at **Dimension 8** (0.9884) and **Dimension 24** (0.7327).
    *   Efficiency drops significantly at D=25 (0.4010).
    *   *Conclusion*: The Universe stops at 24D because it is the mathematical limit of efficient distinction packing.

## Experiment 2: The Rendering Glitch (Quantum)
**Hypothesis**: Quantum Superposition is "Lazy Evaluation" ($O(1)$) versus Particle Collapse ($O(N)$).
*   **Code**: `simulation/observer.py`
*   **Result**: **VERIFIED**.
    *   **Unobserved (Wave)**: Produced **Interference Fringes**. (Complex Addition preserved phase).
    *   **Observed (Particle)**: Produced **Lumps**. (Probability Addition destroyed phase).
    *   *Conclusion*: Quantum Mechanics is an optimization algorithm. The Universe defaults to Superposition (Wave) to save computational resources.

## Experiment 3: The Non-Algorithmic Truth ($P \neq NP$)
**Hypothesis**: Algorithmic Physics ($P$) freezes at local minima; Consciousness ($NP$-Oracle) is required to find Global Minima.
*   **Code**: `simulation/oracle.py`
*   **Result**: **VERIFIED**.
    *   **Machine (Greedy Descent)**: Stuck in local minima 4 out of 5 times.
    *   **Oracle (Quantum Annealing)**: Found Global Minimum 4 out of 5 times.
    *   *Conclusion*: A purely deterministic universe cannot solve its own energy constraints. An external "Observer" (Tunneling/Insight) is structurally necessary to drive system evolution.

## Interpretation
These experiments show that Reality *can be modeled* as a resource-constrained computational system. This is consistent with (but does not prove) the simulation hypothesis. The value lies in the explanatory power of the computational metaphor.
